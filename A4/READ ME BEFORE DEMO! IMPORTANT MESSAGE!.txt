-- Important Message --
Input in this program is handled differently than in the java version, since I could not find something similar to a
Java Scanner within C++. Because of this, this program will instead process the input file WITHOUT parameters when
calling the program in the terminal. In other words, while the Java program would compile and run as follows:

javac Main.java
java Main << A4Input.txt

the C++ version demoed today will run as follows (note the lack of parameters going into ./Assign4):

g++ -o "Assign4" main.cpp
./Assign4

Simply modify the input text file and then run the program without a "<" scanner parameter.
